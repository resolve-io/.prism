## Risk Analysis Process

### 1. Risk Identification

For each category, identify specific risks with E2E testing focus:

```yaml
risk:
  id: 'SEC-001' # Use prefixes: SEC, PERF, DATA, BUS, OPS, TECH
  category: security
  title: 'Multi-tenant authentication boundary violation'
  description: 'Cross-tenant access possible through compromised auth tokens or session hijacking'
  affected_components:
    - 'Authentication Service'
    - 'API Gateway'
    - 'Tenant Context Resolution'
  detection_method: 'E2E testing with multi-tenant scenarios'
  e2e_testable: true
  integration_scope: 'cross-service'
```

**E2E Integration Testing Priority Examples:**

```yaml
# Critical E2E Risks
risk:
  id: 'DATA-001'
  title: 'Cross-tenant data leakage through shared services'
  e2e_validation: 'Complete tenant isolation workflows'
  test_scenarios:
    - 'Tenant A cannot access Tenant B data through any API endpoint'
    - 'Database connections properly isolated by tenant context'
    - 'Shared services maintain tenant boundaries'

risk:
  id: 'SEC-002'
  title: 'API endpoint authentication bypass'
  e2e_validation: 'End-to-end authentication workflows'
  test_scenarios:
    - 'Expired tokens properly rejected across all services'
    - 'Service-to-service auth maintained throughout request chain'
    - 'Token refresh cycles work across integrated services'

risk:
  id: 'TECH-001'
  title: 'Container orchestration dependency failure'
  e2e_validation: 'Full deployment and runtime scenarios'
  test_scenarios:
    - 'Service mesh communication under container restarts'
    - 'Database connections survive container scaling events'
    - 'Load balancing maintains service availability'
```

### 2. Risk Assessment

Evaluate each risk using probability × impact:

**Probability Levels:**

- `High (3)`: Likely to occur (>70% chance)
- `Medium (2)`: Possible occurrence (30-70% chance)
- `Low (1)`: Unlikely to occur (<30% chance)

**Impact Levels:**

- `High (3)`: Severe consequences (data breach, system down, major financial loss)
- `Medium (2)`: Moderate consequences (degraded performance, minor data issues)
- `Low (1)`: Minor consequences (cosmetic issues, slight inconvenience)

### Risk Score = Probability × Impact

- 9: Critical Risk (Red)
- 6: High Risk (Orange)
- 4: Medium Risk (Yellow)
- 2-3: Low Risk (Green)
- 1: Minimal Risk (Blue)

### 3. Risk Prioritization

Create risk matrix:

```markdown
## Risk Matrix

| Risk ID  | Description             | Probability | Impact     | Score | Priority |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- |
| SEC-001  | XSS vulnerability       | High (3)    | High (3)   | 9     | Critical |
| PERF-001 | Slow query on dashboard | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   |
| DATA-001 | Backup failure          | Low (1)     | High (3)   | 3     | Low      |
```

### 4. Risk Mitigation Strategies

**E2E Integration Testing as Primary Mitigation**

For integration-testable risks, E2E tests provide the most comprehensive mitigation:

```yaml

  actions:
    - 'Implement comprehensive multi-tenant E2E test suites'
    - 'Add tenant boundary validation in all API endpoints'

## Risk Scoring Algorithm

Calculate overall story risk score:

```text
Base Score = 100
For each risk:
  - Critical (9): Deduct 20 points
  - High (6): Deduct 10 points
  - Medium (4): Deduct 5 points
  - Low (2-3): Deduct 2 points

Minimum score = 0 (extremely risky)
Maximum score = 100 (minimal risk)
```

- Else if any score ≥ 6 → Gate = CONCERNS
- Else → Gate = PASS
- Unmitigated risks → Document in gate

## Key Principles

**E2E Integration Risk Assessment Focus:**

- **Prioritize Integration-Testable Risks**: Focus on risks best validated through complete system workflows
- **Multi-Tenant Security First**: Tenant isolation and cross-tenant security as highest priority
- **Service Integration Validation**: Cross-service communication and dependency risks as critical

- **API Gateway Security**: End-to-end request routing and security enforcement validation

**Risk Assessment Process:**
- Identify risks early with E2E testing capability in mind
- Use consistent probability × impact scoring with integration complexity weighting
- Provide E2E test-focused mitigation strategies as primary approach
- Link risks to specific E2E integration test scenarios and coverage requirements
- Track residual risk after comprehensive E2E integration testing
- Update risk profile as system integration complexity evolves

**E2E Testing as Risk Mitigation:**
- E2E integration tests provide highest confidence for cross-system risks
- Multi-tenant scenarios validate most critical security and data isolation risks  
- Service integration testing catches risks that unit/component tests cannot detect
- Container orchestration testing validates infrastructure dependency risks
- Complete workflow testing ensures business continuity under failure conditions
