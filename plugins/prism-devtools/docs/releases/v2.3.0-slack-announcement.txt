🏗️ *PRISM v2.3.0 Released!* 🏗️

Teams can now create their own Claude Code skills — right inside the project repo — that are automatically loaded by Claude Code and auto-assigned to the right PRISM agent.

---

*🚀 NEW: Bring Your Own Skill (BYOS)*

These are *native Claude Code project-level skills*. They live in your project's `.claude/skills/` folder — the same path Claude Code already uses for skill discovery. No plugin changes, no registration.

```/byos scaffold team-code-standards --agent dev --phase green```

That creates `.claude/skills/team-code-standards/SKILL.md` directly in your project. Claude Code picks it up automatically in every session.

*Two layers of discovery:*
1. *Claude Code native* — Any skill in `.claude/skills/` is available as a slash command (`/team-code-standards`) for any team member who pulls the repo
2. *PRISM agent injection* — Skills with `prism:` metadata are auto-injected into the right agent during `/prism-loop` (e.g., Dev agent gets your coding standards skill during the GREEN phase)

*How it works:*
• Skills scaffold into your project's `.claude/skills/` — the native Claude Code skill path
• Claude Code discovers them automatically at session start — works like any built-in skill
• PRISM reads `prism:` frontmatter metadata to route skills to the right agent at the right phase
• Commit to git, teammates pull, everyone gets the skill — zero configuration

*Commands:*
• `/byos scaffold <name> --agent dev --phase green` — create a new project skill
• `/byos validate [name]` — check structure, metadata, and token budget
• `/byos list` — see all project skills with their agent/phase assignments

---

*💡 Example Use Cases*

| Skill | Agent | Phase | Purpose |
|-------|-------|-------|---------|
| `team-code-standards` | dev | green | Enforce coding patterns during implementation |
| `team-test-patterns` | qa | red | Enforce test conventions during test creation |
| `team-arch-guard` | architect | planning | Validate stories against architecture decisions |

Each of these becomes a real Claude Code skill — invocable with `/team-code-standards`, auto-discovered by Claude, and injected into the right PRISM agent during the right workflow phase.

---

*🚀 Quick Start*

1. Run `/byos scaffold my-skill --agent dev --phase green`
2. Edit the generated SKILL.md with your team's instructions
3. `git add .claude/skills/my-skill/ && git commit && git push`
4. Teammates pull → Claude Code sees the skill → PRISM injects it into the Dev agent during GREEN

*Where it lives:*
```
your-project/
└── .claude/
    └── skills/
        └── my-skill/
            ├── SKILL.md        ← Claude Code loads this natively
            └── reference/
                └── details.md
```
