🎉 *PRISM v1.7.2 Released!* 🎉

We're excited to announce PRISM v1.7.2 with enhanced documentation and visual workflow guides!

*📊 NEW: Feature Comparison Table*
Ever confused about Skills vs MCP vs Subagents vs Slash Commands? We've added a comprehensive comparison across 12 capabilities (triggered by, context efficiency, permissions, composition, etc.)

Based on IndyDevDan's excellent video "I finally CRACKED Claude Agent Skills"

*🎨 NEW: Visual Workflow Diagrams*
Choose the right brownfield pattern with interactive Mermaid flowcharts:

• *Full Brownfield* - Major enhancements (MANDATORY gates)
• *Brownfield Story* - Standard changes (CONDITIONAL gates)
• *Standard Story* - Simple fixes (OPTIONAL gates)

Each diagram shows decision points, color-coded steps, and feedback loops!

Plus a decision matrix based on files affected, system impact, and risk level.
