🔄 *PRISM v2.2.0 Released!* 🔄

Your entire dev cycle now runs with one command and two approvals.

---

*🚀 NEW: The PRISM Loop*
Start a full TDD development cycle:

```/prism-loop implement login feature```

That's it. Here's what happens automatically:

```SM plans → QA writes failing tests → ⏸ YOU approve → DEV implements → QA verifies → ⏸ YOU approve → Done```

You only interact at the gates:
• `/prism-approve` — approve and advance
• `/prism-reject` — reject, loop back to planning
• `/prism-status` — check where you are
• `/cancel-prism` — stop everything

Tests are *enforced*. QA's tests must actually fail. DEV's code must make them pass. No skipping, no "trust me it works."

---

*📋 NEW: Full Documentation Audit*
We ran a multi-agent audit and found 69% of features were undocumented. Fixed:

• Backfilled 4 missing CHANGELOG versions (v1.8.0 → v2.1.0)
• Corrected feature counts — skills 28→38, agents 10→11, commands 7→13
• Updated stale version refs across 13 docs
• 247 links validated, 0 broken

---

*🚀 Quick Start*

New to PRISM Loop:
1. Open Claude Code in your project
2. Run `/prism-loop [describe what you want to build]`
3. Approve at gates when prompted

Existing users:
→ Update: `cd .prism && git pull origin main`
