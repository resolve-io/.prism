**PRISM v2.2.0** — The Loop

PRISM now runs your entire dev cycle with 3 commands.

**Start it:**
```
/prism-loop implement login feature
```

**What happens:**
```
SM plans story → QA writes failing tests → YOU approve → DEV implements → QA verifies → YOU approve → Done
```

**Your only job is approving gates:**
- `/prism-approve` — approve and advance
- `/prism-reject` — reject, loop back to planning
- `/prism-status` — check where you are
- `/cancel-prism` — stop everything

**The flow:**
1. SM drafts story with acceptance criteria (auto)
2. QA writes tests that FAIL for each AC (auto)
3. Red gate pauses — you review the test coverage
4. `/prism-approve` → DEV implements until tests pass (auto)
5. QA verifies all tests + lint pass (auto)
6. Green gate pauses — you approve final state
7. `/prism-approve` → done

Tests are enforced. If QA's tests don't actually fail, the loop blocks. If DEV's code doesn't make them pass, the loop blocks. No skipping.

Also in this release: full documentation audit — 75 previously undocumented features now in CHANGELOG, all version refs updated, 247 links validated clean.
