# test-design

Create comprehensive E2E integration test scenarios with complete user journey validation for story implementation.

## Inputs

```yaml
required:
  - story_id: '{epic}.{story}' # e.g., "1.3"
  - story_path: '{devStoryLocation}/{epic}.{story}.*.md' # Path from core-config.yaml
  - story_title: '{title}' # If missing, derive from story file H1
  - story_slug: '{slug}' # If missing, derive from title (lowercase, hyphenated)
```

## Purpose

Design a comprehensive E2E integration test strategy that validates complete user journeys and system interactions. Primary focus on integration tests using WebApplicationFactory patterns with containerized dependencies to ensure realistic production-like scenarios while maintaining fast feedback loops.

## Dependencies

```yaml
data:
  - test-levels-framework.md # Unit/Integration/E2E decision criteria
  - test-priorities-matrix.md # P0/P1/P2/P3 classification system
```

## Process

### 1. Analyze Story Requirements

Break down each acceptance criterion into testable scenarios. For each AC:

- Identify the core functionality to test
- Determine data variations needed
- Consider error conditions
- Note edge cases

### 2. Apply Test Level Framework

**Reference:** Load `test-levels-framework.md` for detailed criteria

**Primary Strategy - E2E Integration Tests:**

- **Integration (Primary)**: Complete user journeys with WebApplicationFactory, real database connections via Testcontainers, API endpoints with authentication flows
- **Unit (Supporting)**: Pure logic, calculations, validation rules - only when business logic is complex enough to warrant isolation
- **E2E (Selective)**: Browser-based tests for critical UI workflows - sparingly used due to maintenance overhead

### 3. Assign Priorities

**Reference:** Load `test-priorities-matrix.md` for classification

Quick priority assignment:

- **P0**: Revenue-critical, security, compliance
- **P1**: Core user journeys, frequently used
- **P2**: Secondary features, admin functions
- **P3**: Nice-to-have, rarely used

### 4. Design E2E Integration Test Scenarios

For each identified test need, create comprehensive integration scenarios:

```yaml
test_scenario:
  id: '{epic}.{story}-{LEVEL}-{SEQ}'
  requirement: 'AC reference'
  priority: P0|P1|P2|P3
  level: unit|integration|e2e
  description: 'Complete user journey being tested'
  justification: 'Why this level provides optimal coverage'
  test_pattern: 'WebApplicationFactory|TestContainers|Fixture-based'
  authentication: 'Bearer token|Keycloak|Anonymous'
  database_state: 'Required test data setup'
  api_endpoints: ['endpoints covered in journey']
  arrange_act_assert: 'Clear AAA structure with Shouldly assertions'
  mitigates_risks: ['RISK-001'] # If risk profile exists
```

**Integration Test Design Patterns:**

- **WebApplicationFactory**: Primary test harness for API testing with full application bootstrap
- **Test Fixtures**: Shared resource management (DatabaseFixture, SmtpFixture) via ICollectionFixture
- **Testcontainers**: Real database dependencies (MSSQL) for realistic data operations  
- **Authentication Flows**: Bearer token patterns with test data seeding
- **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Clear structure with Shouldly assertions for readable test validation
- **JSON Serialization**: Consistent patterns for request/response handling

### 5. Validate Integration Coverage

Ensure comprehensive E2E integration coverage:

- Every AC has at least one integration test covering the complete user journey
- Critical authentication flows are validated with real token handling
- Database operations tested against containerized dependencies
- API endpoint interactions verified end-to-end
- Error scenarios include proper HTTP status code validation
- Happy path and edge cases covered within the same integration context
- Test fixtures properly isolate test data while sharing expensive resources

Date: {date}
Designer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Test Strategy Overview

- **Primary Approach**: E2E Integration tests with WebApplicationFactory
- **Test Infrastructure**: Testcontainers (MSSQL) + Fixture-based resource sharing
- **Authentication**: Bearer token flows with seeded test data
- **Assertion Framework**: Shouldly for readable validation
- Total test scenarios: X
- Integration tests: Z (85%+ target)
- Unit tests: Y (10-15% for complex business logic only)
- Browser E2E tests: W (<5% for critical UI flows)
- Priority distribution: P0: X, P1: Y, P2: Z

## Integration Test Scenarios by Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: {description}

#### Test Scenarios

| ID           | Level       | Priority | User Journey                           | Test Pattern              | Endpoints Covered           |
| ------------ | ----------- | -------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| 1.3-INT-001  | Integration | P0       | User authenticates and {core action}   | WebApplicationFactory     | /api/auth, /api/{resource}  |
| 1.3-INT-002  | Integration | P0       | System validates {business rules}      | DatabaseFixture + TestDB  | /api/{validation-endpoint}  |
| 1.3-INT-003  | Integration | P1       | Error handling for {edge case}        | Full container stack      | /api/{resource}             |

#### Test Implementation Pattern

```csharp
[Collection(nameof(DefaultWebApplicationCollection))]
public class {FeatureEndpointTests}
{
    private readonly ActionsApiFactory application;
    
    public {FeatureEndpointTests}(DatabaseFixture db, SmtpFixture smtp, ITestOutputHelper output)
    {
        application = new ActionsApiFactory(db, smtp, output);
        application.InitializeAuthentication();
    }
    
    [Fact]
    public async Task {UserJourney}_ShouldReturn_{ExpectedOutcome}()
    {
        // Arrange - Setup user context and test data
        var client = application.GetHttpClient();
        var bearerToken = await application.GetJwtBearerToken();
        client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = 
            new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", bearerToken);
        var requestData = new { /* test specific data */ };
        
        // Act - Execute the complete user journey
        using var response = await client.PostAsync("/api/{endpoint}", 
            CreateJsonContent(requestData));
        var result = (await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync())
            .Deserialize<{ResponseType}>();
        
        // Assert - Validate complete response with Shouldly
        response.StatusCode.ShouldBe(HttpStatusCode.OK);
        result.ShouldNotBeNull();
        result.{Property}.ShouldBe({ExpectedValue});
    }
}
```

## Test Infrastructure Setup

**Required Fixtures:**
- `DatabaseFixture`: MSSQL Testcontainer with master/tenant databases
- `SmtpFixture`: Email testing infrastructure  
- `DefaultWebApplicationCollection`: Shared fixture orchestration

**Authentication Flow:**
- Keycloak integration for realistic token validation
- Seeded test data in both master and tenant databases
- Bearer token patterns matching production authentication

## Risk Coverage

[Map integration test scenarios to identified risks - each scenario validates complete workflows]

## Recommended Execution Strategy

1. **P0 Integration tests** (primary coverage - complete user journeys)
2. **P0 Unit tests** (complex business logic only)
3. **P1 Integration tests** (secondary workflows) 
4. **P2+ Integration tests** (edge cases and admin scenarios)
5. **Browser E2E tests** (critical UI flows - minimal set)
```

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing E2E integration test design, verify:

- [ ] Every AC has integration test coverage with complete user journey validation
- [ ] WebApplicationFactory pattern used as primary test harness
- [ ] Testcontainers configured for realistic database dependencies
- [ ] Authentication flows tested with Bearer tokens and seeded test data
- [ ] Test fixtures properly shared via ICollectionFixture pattern
- [ ] Arrange-Act-Assert structure with Shouldly assertions consistently applied
- [ ] JSON serialization/deserialization patterns implemented
- [ ] API endpoints tested end-to-end within user journey context
- [ ] Error scenarios include proper HTTP status code validation
- [ ] Database operations validated against containerized MSSQL instance
- [ ] Test scenarios are atomic but cover complete business workflows
- [ ] Unit tests only created for complex business logic requiring isolation
- [ ] Browser E2E tests minimized to critical UI flows only
- [ ] Priorities align with integration-first testing strategy

## Key Principles

- **Integration-first approach**: Prioritize E2E integration tests with WebApplicationFactory for maximum confidence in complete user journeys
- **Containerized realism**: Use Testcontainers for database dependencies to ensure production-like behavior while maintaining test isolation
- **Authentication-aware testing**: Validate complete authentication flows with Bearer tokens and real Keycloak integration
- **Fixture-based efficiency**: Share expensive resources (database containers, application factories) across test collections while maintaining data isolation
- **Risk-based coverage**: Focus integration tests on business-critical paths and error scenarios that matter to users
- **Readable assertions**: Use Shouldly for clear, descriptive test validation that serves as living documentation
- **Minimal unit testing**: Only create unit tests for complex business logic that benefits from isolation - avoid testing framework code or simple operations
- **Fast feedback through smart infrastructure**: Leverage test containers and fixtures for realistic but performant test execution
