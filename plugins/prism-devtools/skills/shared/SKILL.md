# PRISM Shared References

This directory contains shared reference documentation used across multiple PRISM skills.

## When to Use

- Looking for PRISM methodology best practices
- Understanding common command patterns
- Finding cross-skill examples
- Learning about skill dependencies and file structures

## Reference Documentation

- **[Best Practices](./reference/best-practices.md)** - PRISM principles and development guidelines
- **[File-First](./reference/file-first.md)** - Read source files directly, not summaries
- **[Commands](./reference/commands.md)** - Common command patterns across skills
- **[Dependencies](./reference/dependencies.md)** - Skill dependencies and file structures
- **[Examples](./reference/examples.md)** - Real-world usage examples

## Note

These documents are referenced by other skills and provide foundational knowledge for the PRISM methodology. They are not a standalone skill but a shared resource library.
