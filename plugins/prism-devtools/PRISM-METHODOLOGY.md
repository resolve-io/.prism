# PRISM Methodology

## Overview

**PRISM** is a software engineering methodology that refracts the complexity of development into clear, actionable principles. Like a prism that breaks white light into its component colors while maintaining coherence, PRISM combines proven engineering methodologies into a unified framework.

## The PRISM Framework

### Why PRISM?

Like a prism that refracts light into its component colors, this methodology refracts the complexity of software engineering into clear, actionable principles — while still recombining them into a single coherent framework.

### The Five Principles

**P**SP/TSP → **Predictability**
- Structured processes with measurement and quality gates
- Defined roles and responsibilities
- Predictable delivery through disciplined practices

**R**esiliency → **TDD/XP** 
- Test-driven development ensuring robust systems
- Extreme programming practices for adaptability
- Continuous integration and automated testing

**I**ntentionality → **Clean Code/SOLID**
- Clear, purposeful code following proven principles
- Single responsibility and open/closed principles
- Intentional design decisions with clear rationale

**S**ustainability → **XP/Craftsmanship**
- Long-term maintainable practices
- Continuous improvement and learning
- Sustainable development pace and practices

**M**aintainability → **DDD**
- Domain-driven design for complex business logic
- Clear boundaries and ubiquitous language
- Architecture that reflects business reality

## PRISM in Practice

### Agent Coordination
PRISM coordinates AI agents following these principles:
- **Dev Agent**: Focuses on clean, tested, intentional code
- **QA Agent**: Ensures predictability through quality gates
- **Architecture Agent**: Maintains sustainability and maintainability

### Workflow Integration
Each PRISM workflow incorporates all five principles:
1. **Predictable** planning and execution
2. **Resilient** testing and validation
3. **Intentional** design and implementation
4. **Sustainable** practices and patterns
5. **Maintainable** architecture and code

### Quality Through Refraction
Just as a prism separates light into distinct colors, PRISM separates quality concerns into manageable, measurable components while maintaining the coherent whole.
