# Citation Integrity - Read Before You Reference

**NEVER cite, reference, or link to any source you have not actually read.**

This applies universally to:
- External documentation (APIs, libraries, frameworks)
- Web articles, blog posts, official docs
- Internal codebase files and documentation
- GitHub repos, issues, PRs, wikis
- Any URL or file path in responses or documents

## The Rule

Before including ANY reference (hyperlink, file path, or source mention):
1. **Read it first** - Use Read, WebFetch, or appropriate tool
2. **Verify your claim** - Ensure the source actually says what you claim
3. **If unread, don't cite** - Either read it first OR omit the reference

## Violations

❌ Citing a URL based on its title/snippet without reading content
❌ Referencing a file path without reading the file
❌ Claiming a source "supports" something you didn't verify
❌ Including links found via search but never opened

## Correct Behavior

✅ Read source → Extract facts → Then reference it
✅ Can't read it? Say so explicitly, don't cite it as evidence
✅ Source doesn't support your point? Don't cite it for that claim
