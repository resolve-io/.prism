STORY DRAFTING: Create Next Story

Steps:
1. Glob for epic and architecture docs: docs/*.md, docs/epics/*.md
2. Read requirements and technical constraints
3. Draft story with YAML frontmatter (status, size, epic link)
4. Write acceptance criteria in Given/When/Then format
5. Break into tasks sized 1-3 days each
6. Save to docs/stories/ directory

Note: The /sm *draft skill is available for complex story drafting but is not required.
