PLANNING REVIEW: Review Context Before Drafting

Steps:
1. Glob for previous stories: docs/stories/*.md
2. Read completed stories for context and lessons learned
3. Grep for dev notes, retrospectives, and QA feedback
4. Identify patterns, conventions, and technical decisions
5. Summarize key findings that will inform the next story

Note: The /sm *planning-review skill is available for complex planning orchestration but is not required.
