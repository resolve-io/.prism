# Best Practices Guide

**Progressive Disclosure Applied**: This guide uses a hierarchical structure where you start with high-level concepts and progressively drill down into technical details.

**Token-Optimized Structure**:
- This file: ~628 tokens (overview & navigation)
- [best-practices.md](./best-practices.md): ~920 tokens (quick reference for building skills)
- Topic files: 1.4k-2.2k tokens each (deep dives loaded as-needed)

**📑 Navigation**: See [INDEX.md](./INDEX.md) for complete file reference and navigation patterns.

## 🚀 Why These Patterns Matter

### The Problem
Traditional systems load everything at startup:
- ❌ Slow initialization
- ❌ High memory consumption
- ❌ Wasted resources on unused features
- ❌ Poor scalability

### The Solution
Progressive Disclosure + Dynamic Manifests + Deferred Loading:
- ✅ Fast startup (load on-demand)
- ✅ Efficient resource usage
- ✅ Adaptive capabilities
- ✅ Context-aware feature availability

## 📖 Learning Path

### For Beginners
1. Start with **[Progressive Disclosure](./topics/progressive-disclosure.md#what-is-it)** - Understand the philosophy
2. See **[Simple Examples](./topics/progressive-disclosure.md#simple-examples)**
3. Review **[Quick Start](./topics/dynamic-manifests.md#quick-start)**

### For Practitioners
1. Read **[Implementation Patterns](./topics/progressive-disclosure.md#implementation-patterns)**
2. Configure **[Dynamic Manifests](./topics/dynamic-manifests.md#configuration)**
3. Optimize with **[Deferred Loading](./topics/deferred-loading.md#strategies)**

### For Architects
1. Study **[Architectural Principles](./topics/progressive-disclosure.md#architectural-principles)**
2. Design **[Capability Systems](./topics/dynamic-manifests.md#capability-systems)**
3. Implement **[Advanced Optimization](./topics/deferred-loading.md#advanced-techniques)**

## 🔗 Topic Relationships

### Progressive Disclosure → Dynamic Manifests
Progressive disclosure provides the **design philosophy**: show users only what they need, when they need it.

Dynamic manifests provide the **technical implementation**: systems query capabilities at runtime, enabling features progressively.

**Example**: A chat interface starts with basic tools (Level 1), then reveals advanced tools (Level 2) as the user demonstrates expertise → The system's dynamic manifest adjusts which tools are available based on context.

### Dynamic Manifests → Deferred Loading
Dynamic manifests tell you **what's available**.

Deferred loading determines **when to initialize it**.

**Example**: Dynamic manifest says "Tool X is available" → Deferred loading ensures Tool X's code isn't loaded until first use → Saves memory and startup time.

## 🎓 Real-World Applications

### MCP (Model Context Protocol) Skills
```
User opens Claude Code
  ↓
[Progressive Disclosure]
  → Only basic skills shown initially

User works with project files
  ↓
[Dynamic Manifests]
  → System detects project type
  → New relevant skills appear

User invokes advanced skill
  ↓
[Deferred Loading]
  → Skill code loaded on first use
  → Subsequent calls use cached version
```

### Web Applications
```
User visits page
  ↓
[Progressive Disclosure]
  → Core UI loads first

User navigates to dashboard
  ↓
[Dynamic Manifests]
  → Check user permissions
  → Build feature menu dynamically

User clicks "Export Data"
  ↓
[Deferred Loading]
  → Load export library on demand
  → Initialize only when needed
```

## 🛠️ Implementation Checklist

Use this as a quick reference when implementing these patterns:

- [ ] Design information hierarchy (Progressive Disclosure)
- [ ] Identify capability tiers (Basic → Intermediate → Advanced)
- [ ] Implement runtime discovery endpoints (Dynamic Manifests)
- [ ] Create `.well-known/mcp/manifest.json` (MCP specific)
- [ ] Enable lazy initialization (Deferred Loading)
- [ ] Add caching strategies (Optimization)
- [ ] Implement change notifications (Dynamic updates)
- [ ] Test without system restart (Validation)
