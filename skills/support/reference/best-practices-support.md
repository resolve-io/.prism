# Support Engineering Best Practices

## Issue Validation

✅ **DO:**
- Always use Playwright to reproduce
- Capture comprehensive evidence (screenshots, logs, traces)
- Follow customer steps exactly
- Document every step taken
- Check multiple scenarios (edge cases)
- Assess business impact
- Create clear, actionable tasks
- Handoff to appropriate teams (Dev, QA)

❌ **DON'T:**
- Assume issue without reproducing
- Skip evidence capture
- Implement fixes yourself (create dev tasks)
- Write test code yourself (create QA tasks)
- Forget to assess priority
- Skip documentation
- Bypass SDLC process
- Work in isolation (collaborate with teams)
