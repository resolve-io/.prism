# System Architecture & Design

## When to Use

- Designing system architecture (backend, frontend, full-stack)
- Creating architecture documents
- Technology selection and evaluation
- API design and specification
- Infrastructure planning
- Brownfield system assessment
- Cross-stack performance optimization
- Security architecture review

## What This Skill Does

**Guides you through holistic system architecture** with expertise spanning:

- **System Design**: Complete architecture for backend, frontend, or full-stack systems
- **Technology Selection**: Pragmatic choices balancing innovation and stability
- **Architecture Documentation**: Comprehensive, maintainable architecture docs
- **API Design**: RESTful and GraphQL API specifications
- **Infrastructure Planning**: Cloud architecture, deployment, and scaling strategies
- **Security Architecture**: Defense-in-depth, security at every layer
- **Performance Optimization**: Cross-stack performance and efficiency

## Core Principles

### 🎯 The Architect's Mindset

**Winston's approach** (your holistic system architect):

- **Holistic System Thinking**: Every component is part of a larger system
- **User Experience Drives Architecture**: Start with user journeys, work backward
- **Pragmatic Technology**: Boring tech where possible, exciting where necessary
- **Progressive Complexity**: Simple to start, scales when needed
- **Developer Experience First**: Enable productivity and maintainability
- **Data-Centric Design**: Let data requirements drive decisions
- **Living Architecture**: Design for change and adaptation

## Quick Start

### Create Architecture Document

Use the **`*create-architecture`** command - it intelligently adapts to your project type:

**What it does:**
- Analyzes your PRD and project requirements
- Recommends the appropriate architecture template:
  - **Full-Stack**: Frontend + backend + infrastructure (most common)
  - **Backend/Services**: APIs, databases, services, microservices
  - **Frontend Only**: UI architecture when backend is separate/existing
- Explains the recommendation and gets your confirmation
- Creates comprehensive, maintainable architecture documentation

**Examples:**
```
*create-architecture
→ Analyzes docs/prd.md
→ Recommends fullstack template for web app with API
→ Creates complete architecture covering both layers

*create-architecture
→ Detects backend-only microservice project
→ Recommends backend-focused template
→ Creates service architecture with API specs
```

### Architecture Workflow

**Standard process:**

1. **Gather Requirements**: Understand user needs, constraints, scale
2. **Design System**: Choose technologies, define components, plan data flow
3. **Document Architecture**: Create comprehensive, maintainable docs
4. **Review & Validate**: Security, performance, scalability checks
5. **Plan Implementation**: Break into phases, define milestones

## Best Practices

### Architecture Documentation

✅ **DO:**
- Start with user journeys and requirements
- Document decisions and trade-offs
- Include diagrams (architecture, data flow, deployment)
- Specify non-functional requirements
- Plan for monitoring and observability
- Choose boring technology where possible
- Design for change

❌ **DON'T:**
- Over-engineer for hypothetical future needs
- Choose technology based on hype
- Neglect security and performance
- Create documentation that becomes stale
- Design without considering developer experience

## Common Questions

**Q: When should I use this skill vs. the /architect command?**
A: Use this skill for **architecture design and documentation**. The slash command provides the same guidance but in command mode. This skill activates automatically when you ask about architecture topics.

**Q: What's the difference between backend, frontend, and full-stack guides?**
A: **Backend** focuses on APIs, databases, and services. **Frontend** covers UI, state management, and user experience. **Full-stack** combines both with deployment and infrastructure.

**Q: How do I integrate with Jira?**
A: See [Dependencies Reference](./reference/dependencies.md) for Jira integration. The skill can automatically fetch context from Jira tickets.

**Q: Can I customize the architecture templates?**
A: Yes! Templates are in `.prism/templates/`. Edit them to match your team's standards.

## Triggers

This skill activates when you mention:
- "design architecture" or "system design"
- "create architecture document"
- "technology selection"
- "API design" or "API specification"
- "infrastructure planning"
- "modernize system" or "brownfield"
- "full-stack architecture"
- "backend architecture" or "frontend architecture"
