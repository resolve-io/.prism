## 🎉 What's New in PRISM v1.7.2

We're excited to announce PRISM v1.7.2, bringing **enhanced documentation clarity** and **visual workflow guides** to help you master Claude Code development faster!

## 📊 New Feature: Comprehensive Feature Comparison

Ever wondered when to use **Skills vs MCP vs Subagents vs Slash Commands**? We've added a detailed comparison table that breaks down all Claude Code features across 12 key capabilities:

✅ **Triggered By** - Understand who/what activates each feature
✅ **Context Efficiency** - See which features optimize token usage
✅ **Tool Permissions** - Know what each feature can access
✅ **Composition** - Learn how features work together

**Source:** Based on IndyDevDan's excellent video ["I finally CRACKED Claude Agent Skills"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...)

## 🎨 New Feature: Visual Workflow Diagrams

Choosing the right brownfield workflow pattern just got easier! We've added **interactive Mermaid flowcharts** for all three workflow patterns:

### 1. Full Brownfield Workflow
For major enhancements affecting multiple systems
- ⚠️ MANDATORY risk assessment + test design + QA review
- Color-coded diagram shows all required gates

### 2. Brownfield Story Workflow
For standard changes (more than a bug fix)
- ⚠️ CONDITIONAL risk assessment for integration points
- ✅ RECOMMENDED QA review

### 3. Standard Story Workflow
For simple bug fixes in well-understood code
- ✓ OPTIONAL QA review for extra confidence

Each diagram includes:
- Decision points with clear yes/no paths
- Visual color coding (red = mandatory, yellow = conditional, gray = optional)
- User approval gates
- Feedback loops for failed validations

**Plus a decision matrix** to help you choose the right pattern based on:
- Files affected (1-2, 2-4, 5+)
- System impact (single vs multiple)
- Integration points (none, maybe, yes)
- Risk level (low, medium, high)

## 📖 New Feature: Official Documentation Links

All tutorial pages now link directly to official Claude Code documentation! No more hunting for the right docs:

- **Slash Commands** → [code.claude.com/docs/en/slash-commands](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/slash-commands)
- **Skills** → [code.claude.com/docs/en/skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills)
- **Hooks** → [code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks) (+ getting started guide)
- **Sub-Agents** → [code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents)
- **Workflows** → [code.claude.com/docs/en/common-workflows](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/common-workflows) (+ community resources)
- **Tasks** → [code.claude.com/docs/en/overview](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview)

Each tutorial page now shows official docs **right at the top** so you can dive deeper when needed!

## 🔗 Improvement: Documentation Deduplication

We've eliminated content overlap between our two workflow guides:

**Before:** Same content in two places = confusion
**After:** Clear division with cross-references

- **[workflows.md](https://github.com/resolve-io/.prism/blob/main/docs/reference/claude-code-features/workflows.md)** = Tutorial with visual diagrams (learn concepts)
- **[core-development-cycle.md](https://github.com/resolve-io/.prism/blob/main/docs/reference/workflows/core-development-cycle.md)** = Practical reference with bash commands (execute workflows)

Both documents now reference each other with helpful callouts:
> 📖 **Detailed Guide**: See Core Development Cycle for command sequences
> 🎨 **Visual Diagrams**: See Workflows Tutorial for mermaid flowcharts

---

## 🗺️ Improvement: Enhanced Navigation

All documentation now has **bidirectional links**:
- Every major section links back to the main index
- Cross-references between related documents
- 100% link validation (all 44+ links verified working)
