      location: "docs/stories/story-001-prism-system-validation.md:179-204"
      recommendation: "Set a 4-hour time-box for Phase 4. Prioritize critical/high issues; defer low/info issues to backlog if time limit reached. This prevents scope creep and aligns with 16-hour story estimate."

      location: "docs/stories/story-001-prism-system-validation.md:360-363"

      description: "No Epic or PRD reference - story is standalone which may limit strategic context"
      location: "docs/stories/story-001-prism-system-validation.md:9-19"
      recommendation: "Consider linking to PRISM methodology documentation or creating an Epic for system quality initiatives. Not blocking, but helps with long-term planning."

      description: "Path handling should use pathlib for cross-platform compatibility"
      location: "docs/stories/story-001-prism-system-validation.md:366-369"
      recommendation: "Use Python's pathlib.Path instead of string manipulation for file paths. Ensures Windows/Unix compatibility mentioned in technical constraints."

recommendations:
  - "Convert acceptance criteria to Given-When-Then format before Phase 2 implementation - improves test design"
  - "Verify test-artifacts directory exists; create minimal fixtures if needed (estimate +1 hour if creation required)"
  - "Set 4-hour time-box for Phase 4 issue resolution to prevent scope creep"
  - "Use pathlib.Path for cross-platform file handling in validation script"
  - "Prioritize critical/high issues in Phase 4; defer low/info issues to backlog if time-boxed"
  - "Consider creating Epic for system quality initiatives to provide strategic context"

advisory_notes: |
  This is a PRE-IMPLEMENTATION ADVISORY gate, not a standard QA gate. The story has not
  been implemented yet, so traditional QA metrics (traceability, coverage) are not applicable.

  GATE DECISION RATIONALE:
  The story is well-structured and ready for implementation with PASS status because:

  1. STORY QUALITY: Comprehensive and thorough
     - Clear user story with defined persona and value proposition
     - Six measurable acceptance criteria covering all validation aspects
     - Detailed task breakdown across 5 phases with 17 tasks
     - Extensive technical notes including data models, architecture context, and constraints
     - Complete testing requirements with unit/integration test specifications
     - Realistic PSP estimation with rationale (12-20 hours for 8 points)

  2. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA: Measurable and testable (despite format issue)
     - AC1: Cross-reference validation (links, anchors, bidirectional nav)
     - AC2: Progressive disclosure compliance (hierarchy, unlimited depth)
     - AC3: Structure integrity (SKILL.md consistency, file naming)
     - AC4: Metadata completeness (dates, versions, navigation)
     - AC5: Report generation (automated, categorized, coverage tracking)
     - AC6: Quality gates (validation criteria, automation, checklists)

  3. TECHNICAL FOUNDATION: Solid architecture
     - Clear data models for documentation graph, validation rules, and reports
     - Architecture aligns with PRISM principles (sharded docs, progressive disclosure)
     - Performance requirements specified (30s for 100+ files, <100MB memory)
     - Testing strategy defined with >90% coverage target
     - Security and cross-platform considerations addressed

  4. DEFINITION OF DONE: Complete and rigorous
     - 10 specific completion criteria including testing and documentation
     - Quality checkpoints at each phase
     - Measurable outcomes (100% coverage, all critical issues resolved)

  5. ISSUE IMPACT ASSESSMENT:
     - High-priority AC format issue: Improves clarity but does NOT block implementation
       * Existing bullet-point ACs are still measurable and testable
       * GWT format is best practice but not mandatory for development
       * Can be refined during Phase 1 analysis if desired

     - Medium-priority scope issue: Manageable with time-boxing
       * Phase 4 uncertainty is inherent to validation work
       * Recommended 4-hour time-box prevents runaway scope
       * Aligns with PSP estimate (2-3 hours planned + 1 hour buffer)

     - Medium-priority test data issue: Low risk
       * Test artifacts referenced but not critical path
       * Can use synthetic test data if needed
       * Minimal time impact if creation required (+1 hour estimate)

     - Low-priority issues: Nice-to-have improvements, not blockers

  6. RECOMMENDATIONS ARE ADVISORY, NOT BLOCKING:
     - Team can proceed with implementation immediately
     - Recommendations improve quality but are not prerequisites
     - Most recommendations can be addressed during normal development flow

  NEXT STEPS FOR DEV TEAM:
  1. Review these recommendations and decide which to incorporate
  2. Optionally refine ACs to Given-When-Then format (recommended but not required)
  3. Verify test-artifacts directory in Phase 1 (Task 1.1)
  4. Proceed with Phase 1 implementation with confidence
  5. Apply 4-hour time-box when reaching Phase 4
  6. Return for standard QA gate review after Phase 5 completion

process_notes: |
  This gate represents a new pattern: Pre-Implementation Advisory Review.

  PURPOSE:
  - Provide early quality feedback on story definition before dev work begins
  - Identify potential issues that could cause rework or delays
  - Validate story readiness from QA perspective
  - Establish baseline quality expectations

  DIFFERENCES FROM STANDARD QA GATE:
  - No code to review (traceability: N/A)
  - No tests to validate (coverage: N/A)
  - Focus on story quality, not implementation quality
  - Advisory recommendations, not blocking defects
  - PASS status means "ready to implement", not "ready to deploy"

  WHEN TO USE:
  - Complex stories with significant unknowns
  - High-risk features requiring early validation
  - Stories where requirements clarity is critical
  - New patterns or approaches being tried for first time
  - When team requests early QA input

  VALUE:
  - Catches requirement issues before coding starts (shift-left quality)
  - Reduces rework and mid-sprint surprises
  - Improves story quality through early feedback
  - Establishes shared understanding before implementation
  - Saves time overall by preventing false starts
